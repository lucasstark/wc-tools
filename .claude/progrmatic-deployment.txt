Deploying your product
Make a POST request to deploy your product using the following command:

curl -X POST https://woocommerce.com/wp-json/wc/submission/runner/v1/product/deploy \
  -F "file=@/path/to/zip" \
  -F "product_id=<product_id>" \
  -F "username=<username>" \
  -F "password=<app_password>" \
  -F "version=<product_version>"
Replace <product_id>, <username>, <app_password>, and <product_version> with your actual product ID, username, application password, and product version, respectively.

  -F "product_id=<product_id>" \
  -F "username=<username>" \
  -F "password=<app_password>"
